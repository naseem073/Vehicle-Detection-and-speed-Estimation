# Vehicle Detection and Speed Estimation using Opencv


In this project I have have used OpenCV software which uses the Haar cascade to train our machine To implement the above idea two basic requirements, need to be met which are the effective detection of the cars on roads and their velocity measurement. For this purpose to detect the object, in this case the car. we have developed a Haar cascade to detect cars on the roads, whose velocities are then measured using a python script. The real-time application of this project proves to be much useful as it is easy to implement, fast to process and efficient with low cost development. Also, the tool might be useful to apply in simulation tools to measure velocities of cars. This can be further developed to identify all kinds of vehicles as well as to check anyone who breaks a traffic light.
